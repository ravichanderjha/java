## Java Tutorial on Primitive Data Types

### Description

This Java tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to understanding primitive data types in the Java programming language. Primitive data types are the building blocks of Java programs, representing basic values that are not objects. They are essential for storing and manipulating simple data in memory efficiently.

In this tutorial, we will cover the following topics:

1. **Introduction to Primitive Data Types:** We will begin by explaining what primitive data types are, their characteristics, and why they are important in Java programming.

2. **Numeric Data Types:** Explore the numeric primitive data types in Java, including `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, and `double`. We'll discuss their ranges, default values, and when to use each data type.

3. **Character Data Type:** Learn about the `char` data type, which represents single characters in Java and how to use them for handling textual data.

4. **Boolean Data Type:** Understand the `boolean` data type, which has two possible values: `true` and `false`. We'll explore how boolean values are used for decision-making and control flow.

5. **Type Conversion and Casting:** Discover how to convert between different primitive data types and when explicit casting is required to avoid data loss.

6. **Literals and Constants:** Learn about numeric, character, and boolean literals, as well as how to define and use constants in Java.

7. **Variable Declaration and Initialization:** Understand the rules and best practices for declaring and initializing variables of primitive data types.

8. **Default Values:** Explore the default values assigned to primitive data types when they are declared but not initialized explicitly.

9. **Common Operations:** Perform common operations on primitive data types, such as arithmetic operations, comparisons, and logical operations.

10. **Performance Considerations:** Discuss the performance implications of using different primitive data types and when to choose one over another.

### Code Example

```java
// Example code for using primitive data types in Java
public class PrimitiveDataTypesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Numeric data types
        byte age = 25;
        short distance = 10000;
        int population = 100_000_000;
        long totalBalance = 1_000_000_000L;
        float pi = 3.14f;
        double gravity = 9.81;

        // Character data type
        char grade = 'A';

        // Boolean data type
        boolean isJavaFun = true;

        // Output values
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
        System.out.println("Distance: " + distance);
        System.out.println("Population: " + population);
        System.out.println("Total Balance: " + totalBalance);
        System.out.println("Pi: " + pi);
        System.out.println("Gravity: " + gravity);
        System.out.println("Grade: " + grade);
        System.out.println("Is Java Fun? " + isJavaFun);
    }
}
