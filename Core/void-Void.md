In Java, `void` and `Void` are two different concepts.

1. `void` (lowercase):
   `void` is a keyword in Java used as a return type for methods that do not return any value. When a method's return type is `void`, it means the method performs some actions or operations but does not produce a result. Here's an example of a method with a `void` return type:

```java
public void printMessage() {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
```

In this example, the `printMessage()` method does not return any value. It simply prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console.

2. `Void` (uppercase):
   `Void` (with an uppercase "V") is a wrapper class in Java's standard library. It is used to represent the `void` type in situations where you need to treat it as an object. Since `void` cannot be used as a generic type argument, you can use `Void` to represent "no value" in scenarios like working with generics that require a non-primitive type.

For example, you can use `Void` in the context of a generic `Callable`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Callable<Void> task = () -> {
            System.out.println("This is a callable task.");
            return null;
        };
    }
}
```

In this case, the `Callable` takes a type argument of `Void` to indicate that the task does not produce a result.

To summarize:
- `void` is a keyword used as a return type for methods that don't return any value.
- `Void` is a wrapper class used to represent the `void` type in generic contexts or when you need to treat it as an object.
