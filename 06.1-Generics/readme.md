In Java, generics provide a way to create classes, interfaces, and methods with a single, reusable type. Generics allow you to write code that can work with different types while providing type safety. They enable you to specify the type of objects that a collection can contain, or allow you to create classes, interfaces, or methods with a generic type that is specified during usage.

Here's a basic explanation of generics with an example:

### 1. **Generics in Classes:**

Let's say you want to create a generic class for a simple container:

```java
public class Box<T> {
    private T content;

    public void setContent(T content) {
        this.content = content;
    }

    public T getContent() {
        return content;
    }
}
```

In this example, `T` is a type parameter. It can be any non-primitive type (i.e., any class type). When you create an instance of `Box`, you can specify its type:

```java
Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
stringBox.setContent("Hello, Generics!");
String content = stringBox.getContent();
System.out.println("Content: " + content); // Output: Content: Hello, Generics!
```

### 2. **Generics in Methods:**

Generics can also be used in methods to create reusable algorithms. For instance, a generic method to find the maximum of two objects:

```java
public <T extends Comparable<T>> T findMax(T a, T b) {
    return a.compareTo(b) > 0 ? a : b;
}
```

In this method, `<T extends Comparable<T>>` defines a generic type parameter `T` that must be a subtype of `Comparable<T>`. The method then compares objects of type `T` and returns the larger one.

Usage:

```java
String maxString = findMax("Java", "Generics");
System.out.println("Max string: " + maxString); // Output: Max string: Java

int maxNumber = findMax(42, 17);
System.out.println("Max number: " + maxNumber); // Output: Max number: 42

```

In the above example, the `findMax` method is able to work with both strings and integers, thanks to generics.

Generics help in writing more type-safe and reusable code, allowing you to create classes and methods that can work with any data type without sacrificing type safety.
