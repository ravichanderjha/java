# SOLID Principles in Java

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the SOLID principles in Java. SOLID is an acronym that represents a set of five design principles for writing maintainable and flexible software. These principles are fundamental to object-oriented programming and can help you create cleaner and more maintainable code.

## SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
    - This principle encourages classes to have only one reason to change. Each class should have a single responsibility, making it easier to understand, modify, and maintain.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
    - The Open/Closed Principle suggests that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you can add new functionality without altering existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
    - The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting program correctness.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**
    - ISP advises creating small, specific interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones. Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they don't use.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
    - DIP emphasizes depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

## Examples

In this repository, you will find Java code examples that demonstrate how to apply each of the SOLID principles in real-world scenarios.
