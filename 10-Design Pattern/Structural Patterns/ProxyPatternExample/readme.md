The Proxy pattern is a structural design pattern in software engineering that provides an object representing another object. This pattern involves creating a new interface, known as Proxy, which is responsible for controlling access to an object and, optionally, performing other tasks such as lazy initialization or logging.

In the context of Java, the Proxy pattern can be implemented using interfaces and classes. Here's how you can create a Proxy design pattern in Java:

### Step 1: Define the Interface

First, define an interface that both the RealSubject (the real object) and Proxy classes will implement.

```java
// Subject interface
interface Subject {
    void request();
}
```

### Step 2: Implement the RealSubject Class

Create a class that implements the Subject interface. This class represents the real object that the proxy will control access to.

```java
// RealSubject class
class RealSubject implements Subject {
    @Override
    public void request() {
        System.out.println("RealSubject: Handling request.");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Implement the Proxy Class

Create a Proxy class that also implements the Subject interface. This class will control access to the RealSubject object and perform additional tasks if necessary.

```java
// Proxy class
class Proxy implements Subject {
    private RealSubject realSubject;

    @Override
    public void request() {
        if (realSubject == null) {
            realSubject = new RealSubject();
        }
        // Perform additional tasks before delegating the request to the RealSubject
        System.out.println("Proxy: Performing additional tasks before delegating the request.");
        realSubject.request();
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Client Code

In your client code, you can use the Proxy pattern as follows:

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Proxy object
        Proxy proxy = new Proxy();
        
        // Call the request method on the Proxy object
        proxy.request();
    }
}
```

In this example, when the `request()` method is called on the `Proxy` object, it performs additional tasks before delegating the request to the `RealSubject` object. This demonstrates the Proxy design pattern, where the Proxy class controls access to the RealSubject object.

Please note that this is a basic implementation of the Proxy pattern. Depending on your requirements, you might need to implement more complex proxy logic, such as virtual proxy, protection proxy, or remote proxy.
