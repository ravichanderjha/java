### Creational Patterns:
Creational design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

1. **Singleton Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point to that instance.
   - **Type:** Creational

2. **Factory Method Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
   - **Type:** Creational

3. **Abstract Factory Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
   - **Type:** Creational

4. **Builder Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.
   - **Type:** Creational

5. **Prototype Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.
   - **Type:** Creational

Certainly! Here's the addition of the Proxy Pattern to your list of Structural Design Patterns:

### Structural Patterns:

Structural design patterns deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures.

1. **Adapter Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper around the incompatible object.
   - **Type:** Structural

2. **Bridge Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Separates an objectâ€™s abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
   - **Type:** Structural

3. **Composite Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Lets you compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Clients can treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
   - **Type:** Structural

4. **Decorator Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
   - **Type:** Structural

5. **Facade Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Provides a simplified, higher-level interface to a set of interfaces, making it easier to use.
   - **Type:** Structural

6. **Flyweight Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Minimizes memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with related objects.
   - **Type:** Structural

7. **Proxy Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
   - **Type:** Structural


### Behavioral Patterns:
Behavioral design patterns focus on communication between objects, how they operate together, and how they distribute responsibilities.

1. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Passes the request along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
   - **Type:** Behavioral

2. **Command Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
   - **Type:** Behavioral

3. **Interpreter Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Defines a grammar for a language and provides an interpreter to interpret sentences in the language.
   - **Type:** Behavioral

4. **Iterator Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
   - **Type:** Behavioral

5. **Mediator Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.
   - **Type:** Behavioral

6. **Memento Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that it can be restored to this state later.
   - **Type:** Behavioral

7. **Observer Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
   - **Type:** Behavioral

8. **State Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
   - **Type:** Behavioral

9. **Strategy Pattern:**
   - **Explanation:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
   - **Type:** Behavioral

10. **Template Method Pattern:**
    - **Explanation:** Defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
    - **Type:** Behavioral

11. **Visitor Pattern:**
    - **Explanation:** Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. It lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
    - **Type:** Behavioral

These design patterns are essential tools for software developers, providing solutions to common problems encountered during software development. Understanding when and how to apply these patterns can greatly improve the efficiency, maintainability, and scalability of your Java applications.
