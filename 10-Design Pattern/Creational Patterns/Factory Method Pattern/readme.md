**Factory Method Pattern Explanation:**

The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating instances of a class, with its subclasses deciding which class to instantiate. In other words, it defines an interface for creating an object, but it's the responsibility of the derived class or subclasses to implement the instantiation logic. This pattern promotes the idea of creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

**Example:**

Let's consider a scenario where you have a `Vehicle` interface with two concrete implementations: `Car` and `Motorcycle`. We can use the Factory Method pattern to create different types of vehicles without specifying their classes directly.

```java
// Vehicle interface
interface Vehicle {
    void startEngine();
}

// Concrete implementation of Car
class Car implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Car engine started");
    }
}

// Concrete implementation of Motorcycle
class Motorcycle implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Motorcycle engine started");
    }
}

// Vehicle Factory interface
interface VehicleFactory {
    Vehicle createVehicle();
}

// Car Factory implementing VehicleFactory interface
class CarFactory implements VehicleFactory {
    @Override
    public Vehicle createVehicle() {
        return new Car();
    }
}

// Motorcycle Factory implementing VehicleFactory interface
class MotorcycleFactory implements VehicleFactory {
    @Override
    public Vehicle createVehicle() {
        return new Motorcycle();
    }
}

// Client code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a car using CarFactory
        VehicleFactory carFactory = new CarFactory();
        Vehicle car = carFactory.createVehicle();
        car.startEngine();  // Output: Car engine started

        // Create a motorcycle using MotorcycleFactory
        VehicleFactory motorcycleFactory = new MotorcycleFactory();
        Vehicle motorcycle = motorcycleFactory.createVehicle();
        motorcycle.startEngine();  // Output: Motorcycle engine started
    }
}
```

In this example, we have an interface `Vehicle` representing the common behavior of all vehicles. We have two concrete classes, `Car` and `Motorcycle`, implementing the `Vehicle` interface. Additionally, we have a `VehicleFactory` interface defining the Factory Method `createVehicle()`. Two concrete factories, `CarFactory` and `MotorcycleFactory`, implement the `VehicleFactory` interface and provide their own implementations of the `createVehicle()` method.

The client code demonstrates how the Factory Method pattern allows the creation of different types of vehicles without directly instantiating the concrete classes. The appropriate factory is chosen based on the desired type of vehicle, promoting flexibility and decoupling in the code.
