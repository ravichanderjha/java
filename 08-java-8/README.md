Certainly! Here is a list of all the features introduced in Java 8:

1. Lambdas and Functional Interfaces: Support for functional programming through lambda expressions and functional interfaces.
27. New `java.util.function` interfaces: Additional functional interfaces like `DoublePredicate`, `DoubleBinaryOperator`, etc.

2. Stream API: A powerful API for processing collections of data in a functional-style manner.

3. Default Methods: Ability to add default method implementations to interfaces.

4. Optional: A container class to represent optional values and avoid NullPointerExceptions.
25. `java.util.Optional` and `java.util.stream` Improvements: Additional methods for working with optional values and streams.

5. Date and Time API (JSR 310): A modern and improved API for handling dates, times, and periods.

6. Method References: Shorthand syntax for invoking methods using lambda expressions.

7. CompletableFuture: A flexible and robust way to handle asynchronous computations.
20. `CompletableFuture`: A new API for asynchronous programming, including chaining and combining asynchronous tasks.

8. Parallel Array Sorting: Parallel sorting for arrays using multiple cores.

9. Functional-style operations: New methods like `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc., added to `java.util.Collection` interfaces.

15. New `java.util.function` package: Includes functional interfaces like `Function`, `Predicate`, `Consumer`, `Supplier`, etc.
16. Improved `java.util.Optional`: Additional methods for handling optional values.

17. `java.util.concurrent` Updates: New classes like `StampedLock` and enhancements to existing classes.
21. `java.util.concurrent.atomic` Updates: New classes for better atomic operations.

22. `java.util.concurrent.locks` Updates: Enhancements to locks and synchronization.

10. PermGen Removal and Metaspace: Elimination of PermGen memory space and introduction of Metaspace for class metadata storage.

11. Nashorn JavaScript Engine: A new JavaScript engine with improved performance.

12. Date and Time API for JavaFX: Extension of the Date and Time API to JavaFX.

13. Compact Profiles: Reduced Java SE platforms with smaller footprints for specific applications.

14. Base64 Encode/Decode: Native support for Base64 encoding and decoding.



18. Annotations Enhancements: New repeating annotations and type annotations.

19. Type Annotations: Annotations applicable to types (i.e., classes, interfaces, etc.).



23. I/O Improvements: New methods and classes in `java.io` package.

24. `java.util.zip` Improvements: New methods and classes for working with ZIP files.


26. `java.util.StringJoiner`: A class to construct strings with delimiters.


28. Security Enhancements: Improvements in the security framework.

29. Miscellaneous API Updates: Enhancements in various API packages like `java.util`, `java.util.regex`, `java.nio`, `java.util.concurrent`, etc.

These features brought significant improvements to the Java programming language, making it more expressive, efficient, and developer-friendly.
